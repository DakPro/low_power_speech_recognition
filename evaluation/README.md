# Evaluation Datasets
Three datasets were chosen for the model evaluation:
* [SPGISpeech](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kensho/spgispeech) (not used for now due to issues with usage,
issue opened on github)
* [Earnings-22](https://huggingface.co/datasets/revdotcom/earnings22)
* [AMI](https://huggingface.co/datasets/edinburghcstr/ami)

(useless for now) SPGISpeech requires user's consent, so before using it make sure
you are using authentication token.
